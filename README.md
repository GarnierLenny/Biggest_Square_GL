# Biggest_Square_GL
Biggest Square is a parsing algorithm that can find the biggest square in a file

This is Biggest_Square_GL repository.
After cloning this repository, execute "make" in your terminal, this will create a "bsq" binary.
To work bsq needs a valid file to work with, a example of what the file must be like is included in this repository, "file_example"
Once the parsing is done bsq will print the file content with the biggest square in it filled with 'X's.
This project can optimized and will be, I'll keep you updated.
